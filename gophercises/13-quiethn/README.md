## Problem

* https://gophercises.com/exercises/quiet_hn


## Solution

* [main-refactored](main-refactored.oldgo): Original code refactored to prepare it for goroutines.
* [main.go](main.go): Goroutine and cache. It's messy but it works and it's fast.

## Lessons Learned
Not much, it was mostly frustrating. I used goroutines and channels.
