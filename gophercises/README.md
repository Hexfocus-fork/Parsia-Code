My solutions to https://gophercises.com/exercises/ by Jon Calhoun.

You can find everything at https://github.com/gophercises.

For each project, there's a README with source, my program(s), and lessons learned.

Each exercise usually has two versions:

* Normal: Implement the bare minimum to "pass" the lesson.
* Bonus: Clean up the normal version and implement the bonus requirements.

**Lessons learned** is perhaps the most important part of the exercise. It lists what I learned during the lesson.
